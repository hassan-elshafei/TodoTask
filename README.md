# TodoTask

## About this solution

This is a layered startup solution based on [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Domain-Driven-Design) practices. All the fundamental ABP modules are already installed. 

### Pre-requirements

* [.NET 8.0+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)
* [Node v18 or 20](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Configurations

The solution comes with a default configuration that works out of the box. However, you may consider changing the following configuration before running your solution:

* Check the `ConnectionStrings` in `appsettings.json` files under the `TodoTask.Web` and `TodoTask.DbMigrator` projects and change it if needed.

### Before running the application

#### Generating a Signing Certificate

In the production environment, you need to use a production signing certificate. ABP Framework sets up signing and encryption certificates in your application and expects an `openiddict.pfx` file in your application.

This certificate is already generated by ABP CLI, so most of the time you don't need to generate it yourself. However, if you need to generate a certificate, you can use the following command:

```bash
dotnet dev-certs https -v -ep openiddict.pfx -p bfad7b26-3bbf-468f-b969-266d42da0de7
```

> `bfad7b26-3bbf-468f-b969-266d42da0de7` is the password of the certificate, you can change it to any password you want.

It is recommended to use **two** RSA certificates, distinct from the certificate(s) used for HTTPS: one for encryption, one for signing.

For more information, please refer to: https://documentation.openiddict.com/configuration/encryption-and-signing-credentials.html#registering-a-certificate-recommended-for-production-ready-scenarios

> Also, see the [Configuring OpenIddict](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Deployment/Configuring-OpenIddict#production-environment) documentation for more information.

#### Install Client-Side Libraries

Run the following command in the directory of your final application:

```bash
abp install-libs
```

> This command installs all NPM packages for MVC/Razor Pages and Blazor Server UIs and this command is already run by the ABP CLI, so most of the time you don't need to run this command manually.

#### Create the Database

Run `TodoTask.DbMigrator` to create the initial database. This should be done in the first run. It is also needed if a new database migration is added to the solution later.

### Solution structure

This is a layered monolith application that consists of the following applications:

* `TodoTask.DbMigrator`: A console application which applies the migrations and also seeds the initial data. It is useful on development as well as on production environment.
* `TodoTask.Web`: ASP.NET Core MVC / Razor Pages application that is the essential web application of the solution.

### Deploying the application

Deploying an ABP application is not different than deploying any .NET or ASP.NET Core application. However, there are some topics that you should care about when you are deploying your applications. You can check ABP's [Deployment documentation](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Deployment/Index) before deploying your application.

# Todo Management Application

A simple Todo management application built with ASP.NET Core and ABP Framework, implementing basic CRUD operations with status management.

## Features Implemented

✅ **Core Requirements:**
- Complete CRUD operations for todos
- List todos with filtering by status, priority, and date range
- Mark todo as complete functionality
- Basic validation (title required, valid dates)
- Clean Bootstrap frontend with responsive design

✅ **Bonus Features:**
- Implemented using DDD principles
- Added domain events (TodoCompletedEvent)
- Additional filters (priority, date range)
- Sorting options (by due date, priority, creation date)

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core 8
- ABP Framework
- Entity Framework Core
- Bootstrap 5
- jQuery
- SweetAlert2

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. .NET 8 SDK  
2. MVC 
3. SQL Server

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hassan-elshafei/TodoTask.git
   cd TodoTask
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - Open the `appsettings.json` file and update your connection string:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "Default": "Server=localhost;Database=TodoDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
     }
     ```
   - Adjust the `Server` parameter if you're using a named instance or a remote server.
   - For other database systems, change the provider and format the connection string accordingly.

3. **Apply Database Migrations**:
   - Run the following command to create the database schema:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Use the following command:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and go to:
     ```
     [https://localhost:44379/TodoTask]
     ```
   - If you're using a different port, check the terminal output after running the app for the correct URL.

## What I Completed

- Implemented all core requirements as specified
- Added several bonus features including domain events and additional filters
- Created a clean, responsive UI with Bootstrap
- Implemented proper error handling and validation
- Used ABP Framework effectively for application structure

## Challenges Faced

1. **Domain Events Implementation**: Understanding ABP's event bus system required some research, but I successfully implemented the `TodoCompletedEvent`.

2. **AJAX Form Handling**: Ensuring proper anti-forgery token handling with AJAX requests took some debugging.

3. **ABP Framework Learning Curve**: While I was familiar with .NET Core, ABP Framework's conventions required some initial learning.

4. **Status Filtering**: Implementing the status filter with enum conversions between frontend and backend needed careful handling.

## Time Spent

- Approximately 6 hours total (including research and testing)
- Breakdown:
  - Backend implementation: 3 hours
  - Frontend development: 2 hours
  - Testing and debugging: 1 hour

## Notes

- The application uses ABP Framework's basic template which provided helpful scaffolding.
- I focused on clean code organization and proper separation of concerns.
- The solution includes both backend API and frontend UI components.

## Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would:
1. Add unit tests  
2. Implement pagination for large todo lists  
3. Add user authentication  
4. Enhance the UI with more interactive elements  
5. Add export functionality for todos
